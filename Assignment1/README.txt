    	• Output files – top-week.csv, top-month.csv, top-overall.csv
      
    • • Q.9 assign1.sh (top-level script that runs the entire assignment)
    	• Reads from - neighbor-districts-modified.json, data-all.json

--------------

Run bash script as ./bash_script_name.sh in terminal.


You can either run assign1.sh or the first 7 bash scripts in sequence as mentioned above for Questions 2-8 to generate the entire assignment.


Note - Individual bash scripts can only be executed if the files (.csv) it reads from are generated by the previous (sequential) bash script. 


Run time in personal system for assign1.sh = ~4 minutes 
(Please let the script run for twice the mentioned time in worst case scenario)
