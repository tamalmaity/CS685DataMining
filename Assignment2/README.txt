--------------

Run bash script as ./bash_script_name.sh in terminal.


You can either run assign2.sh or the first 11 bash scripts in sequence as mentioned above for Questions 1-11 to generate the entire assignment.


Note - Individual bash scripts can only be executed if the files (.tsv/.csv) it reads from are generated by the previous (sequential) bash script. 


Run time in personal system for assign1.sh = ~2 minutes 
(Please let the script run for twice the mentioned time in worst case scenario)
